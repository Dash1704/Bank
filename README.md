# Bank

My first tech test which will allow a user to deposit and withdraw money in and from their bank and have the ability to see their bank statement.

To install dependencies: run 'npm install jest'

This code is a basic way of depositing and withdrawing money in and from an account and then being able to see your transaction history on a bank statement.

Below is how the app runs, it prints out the transactions made after the user has deposited and withdrawn. The user does not need to enter a date, as the transaction will automatically show the date on which it was made. If the user makes a deposit of 10 or 10.5, the statement will show 10.00 and 10.50, respectively.
